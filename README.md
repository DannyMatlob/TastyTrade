## Installation

1. Install the EAS client and Expo globally.
```bash
      npm install --global eas-cli
      npm install --global expo
   ```

2. Install dependencies using NPM:
```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Starting the application
Using android emulator or physical device (AVD [Installable through Android Studio]):
```bash
   eas build --profile development --platform android
   npx expo start --android
   press
   ```

EAS will build an Android APK on the cloud, which you can then download to your mobile device through the QR code.
Connect your mobile device with a cable, and the app should connect to the expo server.

Otherwise, if your emulator is open, it should automatically connect to the app.
